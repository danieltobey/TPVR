// RIGHT-hand rotation calibration -- derived from real isolated-axis data
// this session (2026-08-01), NOT hand-composed corrective quaternions like
// the earlier, reverted attempts (see git history and CLAUDE.md section 12
// for the full account of what was tried and failed before this).
//
// Methodology: two SEPARATE, slow, isolated single-axis motions were
// captured via [dusk::vr::handrot] logging -- a roll (twisting the
// controller like a doorknob) and a yaw (turning it like shaking your
// head "no"). For each, the WORLD-frame rotation axis between a
// before/after sample pair was computed (q_after * conj(q_before) ->
// axis-angle) via a verification script, not by hand, then un-rotated by
// that test's own "before" orientation to get the axis in the
// CONTROLLER's own local/body frame. That's what kLocalForward (from the
// roll motion) and kLocalUp (from the yaw motion) are: the controller's
// own forward and up axes, in its intrinsic local coordinate system,
// independent of which way it happened to be held during either test.
//
// The previous (reverted) attempt's fatal flaw: it derived "local up" from
// an ASSUMED static target (world (0,1,0) at whatever arbitrary
// orientation a reference pose happened to be in) rather than from real
// motion -- cross-validating that version against held-out data was off
// by 100+ degrees. This version's kLocalForward/kLocalUp are BOTH
// motion-derived, and cross-validate against each other (forward vs. the
// independently-measured yaw rotation axis, which must be perpendicular
// to forward for any single rigid body) to within ~10 degrees of the
// expected 90 -- consistent with ordinary hand-motion imprecision, not a
// methodology error. Gram-Schmidt orthogonalized in the derivation script
// (splitting that ~10 degrees onto "up") to get an exact orthonormal
// frame, since a rotation matrix can't represent non-perpendicular basis
// vectors at all.
//
// Scope: RIGHT hand only -- this data all came from the right controller.
// Left hand is presumed to need its own separate calibration (the earlier
// "left hand upside down, right hand fine" report is real evidence the
// meshes are mirrored, not identical) and is NOT touched here; it still

// SESSION C, 2026-08-02 (rotation calibration, take 3): the previous
// version of this function (git history) applied its correction matrix to
// WORLD-space vectors AFTER rotateVecByQuat -- proven this session to be
// mathematically incapable of being correct at any orientation other than
// the single reference pose it was derived from (a rotation matrix applied
// post-rotation does not commute with the runtime's actual quaternion q,
// so "correct at the calibration pose" does not imply "correct in
// general"). This is the likely reason every previous "verified correct"
// correction still drifted wrong in general headset movement.
//
// This version fixes that shape: the correction is applied to
// kLocalRight/kLocalUp/kLocalForward THEMSELVES, in the controller's own
// local frame, BEFORE rotateVecByQuat -- see buildHandMtx() below. Since
// this only ever touches the fixed local axes and never anything that
// depends on q, it is mathematically capable of being correct for every
// orientation at once, not just one.
//
// It also replaces the previous version's camera-forward proxy (an
// unverified assumption that the camera was looking where the controller
// pointed during calibration -- flagged as the leading suspect for the
// old correction's failure) with OpenXR's own "aim pose" action, a
// runtime-computed reference for "the direction this controller is really
// pointing" that needs no assumption about where the player was looking.
// A ~160-sample capture (right hand, waved through a variety of
// orientations, see CLAUDE.md section 12's "Session C" writeup) showed
// R_grip^-1 * R_aim is a genuinely constant matrix EXPRESSED IN THE
// CONTROLLER'S LOCAL FRAME (deviation ~0.001 degrees across all samples,
// a fixed ~60 degree rotation) -- unlike an earlier, discarded capture on
// this same runtime where the analogous quantity was constant in WORLD
// space instead (physically impossible for a real aim pose; ruled out as
// unusable, see CLAUDE.md). This capture's local-frame constancy is
// exactly what a genuine fixed body-frame offset between grip and aim
// should look like, so it was used as ground truth here.
//
// Derivation (script, not by hand): averaged R_grip^-1 * R_aim across all
// samples, re-orthonormalized via SVD to denoise. Aim pose's own
// right/up/forward axes in the grip's local frame are then
// Rrel @ (1,0,0) / Rrel @ (0,1,0) / Rrel @ (0,0,+1) respectively -- note
// +Z, not OpenXR's spec "-Z is the aim direction": this codebase's
// existing kLocalRight/kLocalUp/kLocalForward satisfy
// cross(right,up)=+forward (verified directly), the opposite handedness
// convention from OpenXR's own right=+X/up=+Y/forward=-Z, so +Z is the
// self-consistent choice here -- using -Z produces a matrix with
// det=-1 (a mirror), a clear tell of the handedness mismatch. Solved
// M = target_frame * current_frame^T (current_frame's columns are
// orthonormal, so its inverse is its transpose), then SVD-cleaned to
// guarantee a proper rotation. Verified before writing this: det(M) =
// +1.0 exactly, and M @ each of kLocalRight/kLocalUp/kLocalForward
// reproduces its corresponding aim-pose target axis to within numerical
// noise (0.0000 degrees).
//
// NOT yet confirmed in-headset -- next step for whoever picks this up:
// rebuild, test normal gameplay movement (not just the calibration pose),
// and specifically check whether it now holds up across general head/hand
// motion rather than drifting wrong away from one reference orientation,
// which is the failure mode this new local-space shape is meant to fix.
// UPDATE 2026-08-02 (post-rotateVecByQuat-fix retuning): fixing
// rotateVecByQuat's inverse-rotation bug (see that function's comment)
// invalidated the two empirical corrections that used to live here
// (kMeshRollCorrectionDeg, kWristRollCorrectionDeg -- git history has the
// full trial-and-error account, including the hard-won discovery that
// dest column 0 ("right") is the mesh's true facing/heading axis, not
// column 2 as the original "right/up/forward" naming assumed).
//
// UPDATE, same day: the first attempt at solving this directly (from a
// verbal description alone) was still wrong. Redone from two actual
// screenshots instead, which gave real observed directions rather than an
// assumption for one of the three axes:
//   - Photo 1 (neutral grip, CURRENT/wrong result of the previous matrix):
//     thumb toward the viewer, palm down.
//   - Photo 2 (controller rotated by the user to some other pose): thumb
//     up, palm left -- this happens to be the DESIRED look, just reached
//     by rotating away from neutral rather than by the calibration's
//     resting orientation. Confirms the dynamic mapping is still fine;
//     only the neutral-pose offset is wrong.
// Method (script, not by hand): computed the actual current local vectors
// (this matrix's previous coefficients applied to kLocalRight/Up/
// Forward), used photo 1's two DIRECTLY OBSERVED axes (palm, thumb) plus
// the cross-product relationship (facing = palm x thumb, since
// cross(right,up)=forward here means cross(up,fwd)=right cyclically) to
// derive the third (facing) rather than assuming it, then solved for Rq0
// (the actual fixed neutral-pose rotation) from that full correspondence.
// Used the same Rq0 to back out the local vectors needed for photo 2's
// directions (also fully derived, same cross-product check). Folded
// directly into this matrix, replacing the aim-pose-only M entirely (this
// IS the composed result, not a separate step) -- verified: proper
// rotation (det=+1), reproduces all three target vectors to 0.0000
// degrees.
//
// UPDATE, same day: STILL wrong in-headset -- the photo-1/photo-2
// derived matrix above produced a THIRD distinct wrong result (pointing
// straight down, palm toward viewer), confirmed via a fresh screenshot
// (photo 3). Re-solved the exact same way, this time using photo 3 as the
// new "current" observation (facing=down, palm=toward viewer, thumb=
// derived via cross product) against the SAME target as before (facing=
// forward, palm=left, thumb=up, from photo 2 -- still the goal, unchanged).
// Verified: proper rotation (det=+1), reproduces the target to 0.0000
// degrees, same as every previous attempt's verification -- worth noting
// explicitly, since this is now the SECOND time a matrix that verified
// perfectly in Python still came out wrong in-headset. This does not mean
// the math is wrong; it means at least one of the world-direction
// OBSERVATIONS feeding the math (facing/palm/thumb as read off a
// screenshot) has been mismeasured or mislabeled somewhere -- e.g. the
// assumed correspondence between dest columns (right/up/forward) and the
// mesh's actual (facing/palm/thumb) anatomy, or the world-axis convention
// used to encode each screenshot as vectors, could be subtly off in a way
// that isn't caught by internal consistency checks (the math is
// self-consistent by construction regardless of whether the INPUT
// observations are correct). NOT yet confirmed in-headset -- if this is
// ALSO wrong, the next step should be re-examining that mapping assumption
// directly rather than deriving a fourth matrix the same way.
//
// UPDATE, same day: STILL wrong -- photo 3's matrix produced a FOURTH
// distinct result (photo 4: facing right, palm down), confirmed via
// another screenshot. Re-solved the same way again (photo 4 as current,
// same photo-2 target as always). Notable pattern: this new matrix is
// almost exactly the photo-1/photo-2-derived matrix from two updates ago,
// with its "up" and "forward" rows both negated (i.e. a clean 180-degree
// flip in that (up,forward) block specifically, facing row unchanged) --
// consecutive derivations are oscillating by 180 degrees in the same
// block rather than converging closer to correct. This is suspicious: it
// could mean the user isn't holding the exact same real controller
// orientation between test photos (each screenshot's implied Rq0 assumes
// the SAME fixed neutral pose as every other screenshot, which may not
// hold in practice), or that the up=palm/forward=thumb anatomical mapping
// assumption (never independently verified, only inferred from a
// handedness self-consistency check early on) is swapped.
//
// ROOT CAUSE FOUND, same day: user confirmed they held the controller the
// SAME way every test ("buttons straight up") -- but that constrains only
// ROLL (rotation about the controller's own pointing axis), not which way
// the arm was actually aimed (pitch/yaw). So each of the 4 test photos was
// at a genuinely DIFFERENT real aim direction, which is exactly why
// "facing" cycled through left/down/right/up across tests -- comparing
// world-ABSOLUTE directions across photos taken at different aim
// directions was the actual bug, not the linear algebra (every individual
// derivation's 0.0000-degree self-verification was real; the WRONG THING
// was being verified). Confirmed by computing, for each of the 4 photos,
// the roll angle between its OWN observed (facing,palm,thumb) frame and a
// facing-aligned version of the target frame (i.e. "how far is this
// photo's roll from correct, RELATIVE TO its own facing direction" rather
// than vs. a fixed world direction) -- all four gave EXACTLY -90.00
// degrees, independent of which way each photo's facing pointed. This is
// the real, aim-direction-invariant signal: a pure -90 degree roll error
// around whatever the current facing/pointing axis is, not a full 3D
// misorientation at all. (Second bug found while verifying the fix: the
// roll-correction rotation formula's sign convention -- newUp = c*up -
// s*fwd, newFwd = s*up + c*fwd, same convention as the old, now-removed
// applyMeshRollCorrection/applyWristRollCorrection functions -- represents
// the OPPOSITE angle sign from the textbook axis-angle rotation formula;
// initially plugging in the naive +90 fix for the measured -90 error gave
// nonsense until this was caught by checking a full angle sweep instead of
// assuming the sign.) Verified via the full sweep: theta=-90 (in this
// codebase's own rotation-formula convention) gives EXACTLY 0.0 degrees
// residual roll error simultaneously for all 4 independent real test
// photos -- not just one -- which is a much stronger confirmation than
// any single derivation's internal 0.0000-degree self-check has been so
// far this session, since it holds across genuinely different real aim
// directions instead of just being self-consistent by construction.
// Composed by applying this -90 degree roll (in the (up,forward) plane,
// holding right/facing fixed, matching applyMeshRollCorrection/
// applyWristRollCorrection's original intent) directly on top of the
// photo-4-derived matrix, then folded down into this single matrix.
// NOT yet confirmed in-headset -- the theory is now well-validated by
// multiple independent real data points agreeing exactly, which the
// previous four attempts never had, but this is still a NEW matrix that
// hasn't itself been tested yet.
//
// CONFIRMED, same day: user tested the above matrix across FIVE poses --
// neutral, roll left, roll right, pitch up (all consistent with each
// other, confirming the dynamic mapping and the roll fix both hold up
// across real orientation changes, not just one pose) -- and pitch DOWN
// 90 degrees from neutral, which looked CORRECT. This means the dynamic
// mapping and roll calibration are validated, but there's a residual
// static PITCH offset -- neutral should look like what "pitch down 90"
// currently shows. Fixed by applying one more -90 degree rotation in the
// SAME (up, forward) plane (holding right/facing fixed) on top of the
// above matrix, per the user's direct instruction ("pitch it down 90
// degrees"), folded down into this single matrix the same way as every
// previous update in this section.
//
// UPDATE, same day: WRONG PLANE -- user reported the above rotated the
// hand 90 degrees around world Y (vertical) instead of world X (lateral).
// This makes sense: the (up,forward) plane rotates around 'right'
// (facing) -- so at this test's specific neutral pose, 'right' apparently
// points close to world Y (vertical) currently, not a lateral direction,
// meaning a rotation around it reads as a Y-axis/vertical spin rather
// than the intended pitch-like adjustment. Reverted to the previous
// (dynamic-mapping-validated) matrix and instead rotated -90 degrees in
// the (right, forward) plane, holding 'up' fixed -- the other available
// local rotation plane, per the local axis mapping established back in
// section 12 (kLocalRight=pitch axis, kLocalUp=yaw axis,
// kLocalForward=roll axis; this plane rotates around 'up', i.e. the yaw
// axis).
//
// UPDATE, same day: ALSO wrong -- user asked to go back to the Y-axis
// rotation instead (i.e. revert to the (up,forward)/'right'-axis version
// from two updates ago). Worth flagging explicitly: this back-and-forth
// (Y wrong -> try X -> X also wrong -> back to Y) is consistent with the
// same "world axis identity depends on which way you're currently aiming"
// ambiguity CLAUDE.md's photo1-5 saga already ran into (facing direction
// cycled through 4 different world directions across tests that were
// supposed to be "the same neutral pose", because holding a fixed ROLL
// doesn't fix aim direction) -- comparing "which world axis did this spin
// around" between separate test sessions may not be reliable the same way
// the earlier photo-based approach wasn't. Reverted to the (up,forward)
// plane / 'right'-axis rotation (matching CLAUDE.md's "pitch it down 90
// degrees" matrix).
//
// UPDATE, same day: user asked for Z axis instead. This is the third and
// last of the three available single-axis rotation planes (the other two,
// (up,forward)/'right' and (right,forward)/'up', were both already tried
// and reported wrong) -- (right,up) plane, holding 'forward' fixed.
// Applied -90 degrees here (same sign convention as every other attempt
// this session) on top of the dynamic-mapping-validated matrix. NOT yet
// confirmed in-headset. If this is ALSO wrong, all three single-axis
// planes at -90 degrees will have been tried without success -- worth
// stepping back to the more rigorous aim-invariant methodology (multiple
// real test photos at different orientations, solving directly like the
// roll fix earlier in this section) rather than continuing to guess
// individual planes/signs one at a time.
//
// UPDATE, same day: user confirmed this is the correct plane/axis (Z),
// just the wrong direction -- flipped from -90 to +90 (180 degrees from
// the previous value), same (right,up) plane, holding 'forward' fixed.
// NOT yet confirmed in-headset.

// Goal (explicit user request): first-person item aiming (bow, slingshot,
// hookshot, boomerang -- everything that funnels through
// daAlink_c::setBodyAngleToCamera(), d_a_alink_link.inc, the same function
// gyro/mouse/touch aim already hook into) should follow the real RIGHT
// controller's pointing direction, not stick/gyro/mouse deltas -- point the
// controller where you want the shot to go, the way a real bow/slingshot/
// hookshot/boomerang throw would work. Right hand chosen unconditionally
// (explicit user choice) regardless of which hand the 3D item model happens
// to render in for a given item -- simpler and more predictable than
// tracking each item's own (sometimes switchable, e.g. checkBowGrabLeftHand())
// hand assignment.
//
// FIRST VERSION (reverted) reused buildHandMtx()'s right-hand mesh-forward
// calibration (applyStaticCorrection(right_hand_cal::kLocalForward), rotated
// by the grip quaternion). Real in-headset test found it off by a FIXED
// 90 degrees in yaw AND, more tellingly, physically yawing the controller
// made pitch/roll appear to swap -- direct evidence the underlying vector
// isn't correctly axis-aligned with the physical pointing direction at all
// (right_hand_cal's "forward" was calibrated for how the MESH should
// visually look holding a sword, section 12, never verified as "the
// direction a player naturally points this controller to aim"). A follow-up
// fixed-angle-space correction (subtract 90 degrees from yaw, negate pitch)
// was tried and also rejected without even reaching the headset: per this
// project's own hard-won lesson (CLAUDE.md, "don't attempt a column swap to
// fix an axis-confusion symptom -- provably cannot work", full algebraic
// proof in CLAUDE.md section 12) a UNIFORM correction -- whether a matrix
// column swap or a constant angle offset -- cannot change which physical
// rotation axis (yaw/pitch/roll) feeds which computed output; it can only
// shift the resting orientation. The "pitch/roll swapped" symptom is
// exactly what that lesson predicts for a wrong SOURCE vector, so patching
// the angle output further was the wrong class of fix.
//
// CURRENT VERSION: uses OpenXR's own AIM POSE directly instead of deriving
// from the grip/mesh calibration at all -- aim pose is spec-defined
// specifically as "the direction the user would point the controller to
// indicate a target" (local -Z axis), computed by the runtime from the
// controller's own tracked geometry, not from anything this app assumes
// about mesh orientation. This sidesteps the whole "which mesh-calibrated
// local axis is really the pointing direction" question by not depending on
// right_hand_cal/applyStaticCorrection at all. Local -Z convention and the
// rotateVecByQuat()-direct approach both mirror
// vr_stereo_render.hpp's computeHeadWorldForward() (the HMD's own already-
// proven-correct forward direction, confirmed via working VR movement
// direction) exactly, rather than inventing a new convention.
//
// Known risk, accepted for now: aim pose was found to be runtime-
// dependently unreliable in THIS project once before (CLAUDE.md section 12,
// "aim pose data itself is broken on whatever runtime this was tested on")
// -- but that finding was about the RELATIVE offset between grip and aim
// pose staying constant across many samples in one specific capture; a
// LATER capture on the SAME runtime showed aim pose behaving as a proper,
// physically meaningful fixed local-frame offset from grip. Used directly
// here (not derived FROM grip at all), so that specific failure mode
// doesn't apply the same way -- but this hasn't been proven reliable for
// this exact use yet either; worth a real in-headset test before trusting
// it as the final answer.
//
// Returns a world-space (game-world-convention, matching buildHandMtx()'s

// flip needed) direction vector, NOT an angle -- callers convert to this

// FIXED 2026-08-07/08 (user request: "I want the game to stay in first
// person while talking to npcs"): third-person fallback used to trigger
// on `checkEventRun()` alone, which cannot distinguish an actual
// cutscene/transition from ordinary NPC dialogue -- it's ONE shared flag
// (dEvt_control_c::mEventStatus, `d_event.cpp`) that every event type
// flips identically: cutscenes (dEvt_type_OTHER_e/COMPULSORY_e), door/
// transition events (dEvt_type_DOOR_e/TREASURE_e -- confirmed via
// doorCheck() in d_event.cpp, which sets `mMode = dEvt_mode_DEMO_e`, the
// SAME mode a scripted cutscene uses), AND plain conversations
// (dEvt_type_TALK_e) all set it. The one thing that DOES distinguish
// plain dialogue is dEvt_control_c's own mode: talkCheck()/talkXyCheck()
// set it to dEvt_mode_TALK_e specifically, while every cutscene/door/
// treasure/compulsory path sets dEvt_mode_DEMO_e or
// dEvt_mode_COMPULSORY_e instead -- so checking getMode() ==
// dEvt_mode_TALK_e is what actually separates "just talking" (stay
// first-person) from "an authored camera/scripted demo has taken over
// Link's body" (still needs the third-person fallback, same reasoning as
// cutscenes below).
//
// The first version of this ALSO required !checkPlayerDemoMode(), on the
// theory that story-important conversations are sometimes staged as full
// demos with dialogue baked in rather than a plain TALK event, so that
// flag should distinguish "just talking" from "a demo with dialogue."
// User-reported regression ("dialogue is still third person") plus a real
// [dusk::vr::fpdiag] capture proved that theory wrong: checkPlayerDemoMode()
// reads TRUE for the ENTIRE DURATION of an ordinary, plain conversation
// (mode=1/TALK the whole time, playerDemoMode=1 the whole time) -- Link
// apparently runs through some local demo-driven "stop and face the NPC"
// state just to hold a normal conversation at all, not only for scripted
// cutscenes-with-dialogue. That guard was therefore excluding essentially
// ALL dialogue, not just the cutscene case it was meant to carve out.
// Removed -- dEvt_control_c's own mode is the only signal actually needed;
// the logged mode=2/DEMO blocks for real cutscenes/other events in the
// same capture confirm nothing gets confused by dropping it.
//
// FIXED 2026-08-08 (user request: "make every cutscene that has link
// loaded in first person"): the DEMO/COMPULSORY branch below used to be a
// blanket third-person fallback for every cutscene/door-transition event,
// on the theory that an authored cutscene camera isn't guaranteed to be
// looking at Link at all. That's still true for shots that don't actually
// feature Link's own body -- many cutscenes swap in a separate stand-in
// demo actor and hide the real Link actor entirely rather than animating
// him directly (or just point the camera elsewhere while he's parked
// off-camera) -- so this doesn't blanket-flip to first-person; it checks
// whether Link's OWN body is actually the thing being drawn this frame via
// checkPlayerNoDraw() (d_a_alink_link.inc -- the same flag
// draw() itself already gates mpLinkModel's draw call on, driven either by
// a camera-attention "hide player" bit or FLG0_PLAYER_NO_DRAW, both of
// which are only ever set from the demo/cutscene code in
// d_a_alink_demo.inc, never during ordinary gameplay). When Link is
// genuinely loaded/visible in the shot, stay first-person same as

// CORRECTED 2026-08-20 -- the previous version of this function re-read

// on the assumption (stated in an earlier version of this comment, never
// actually verified against real data) that mOrderIdx stays valid for an
// event's whole duration once entry() accepts it. A real in-headset
// capture (user report: "the door was def[initely] 3rd person", directly
// contradicting what a live re-read reported for that same test) proved
// this false: mOrderIdx is set at ORDER-REQUEST time, inside
// dEvt_control_c::order() (d_event.cpp) -- NOT reassigned by entry() to
// point at whichever specific order ultimately got accepted. entry() also
// unconditionally resets mNum=0 right before walking the pending list, so
// ANY unrelated order() call from elsewhere in the game arriving WHILE a
// door/cutscene event is still playing (common -- plenty of ambient
// systems speculatively try ordering events every frame) writes its own
// type straight into mOrder[0], which mOrderIdx is very often still
// pointing at (only one event is normally active) -- silently corrupting
// a live re-read even though the original event never actually stopped
// running. The capture showed exactly this: a real DOOR_e (type 1)
// sequence reading stable for many frames, mode unchanged the whole
// time, then flipping mid-event to read OTHER_e (type 2) for a stretch
// before settling back -- forcing third-person for part of a sequence
// that was never anything but a door transition.
//
// FIX: capture the type ONCE, at the moment this event's mMode first
// transitions into DEMO_e/COMPULSORY_e, and hold that captured value
// fixed for as long as mMode stays in that scripted-event range --
// mMode is far more stable than mOrder[]/mOrderIdx (order() never
// touches it at all; only entry()'s acceptance switch and endProc() do),
// so this is immune to any mOrder[]/mOrderIdx drift for the rest of the
// event's duration, no matter how many unrelated order() calls happen
// meanwhile. Local statics are safe here even though this function is
// called many times per real frame from several call sites
// (isFirstPerson() itself, plus dusk::vr::isRealCutsceneRunning()'s
// separate "Hide Body" call site in d_a_alink.cpp) -- mMode only changes
// once per Step(), not per call, so repeat calls within one frame just
// re-observe the same already-captured state (a no-op), not a fresh edge.

// the "ConcatView" load type (J3DMtxBuffer::create() explicitly routes
// ConcatView models to setNoUseDrawMtx() instead of allocating a real
// DrawMtx array), and J3DShapeMtxConcatView::load() for THIS load type

// getUserAnmMtx(), which J3DMtxBuffer::createAnmMtx() aliases directly onto
// mpAnmMtx -- the exact same buffer setAnmMtx() writes and getAnmMtx()
// reads) through an sMtxPtrTbl[]/getDrawMtxFlag()/getDrawMtxIndex()
// redirection -- getDrawMtxPtr()/calcDrawMtx() are never consulted for this
// model's shapes at all. So the fix is simpler than the superseded version:
// mark getAnmMtx() itself live -- no separate viewCalc() recompute needed,
// since applyTrackedHandMtx()'s existing setAnmMtx() call already writes
// AND records (via J3DModel::setAnmMtx()'s own record_final_mtx() call,
// J3DModel.cpp) the exact matrix that matters. mark_live_this_frame() just
// needs to tell resolve_replacement() not to substitute a stale
// once-per-tick-interpolated value for it. Called once per real frame from
// vr_main.cpp's tick(), before the per-eye loop opens (both eyes share the
// same matrix, no per-eye duplication needed).
// SWIMMING (user request 2026-08-09): don't force the tracked controller
// pose onto Link's hands while swimming -- skip entirely so the body's own
// once-per-sim-tick swim-stroke hand animation (already synced into these
// same two joints by d_a_alink.cpp's "Always set these" body-joint resync)
// plays through frame_interp's normal once-per-tick interpolation instead,
// exactly as it already does on flatscreen. Checked INSIDE this function
// (rather than skipping the call at the vr_main.cpp call site) so the
// override write and the mark_live_this_frame() call are skipped together

// CORRECTED (round 3, same session): mLeftItemJntNo/mRightItemJntNo are
// NOT the same joints as the hand joints setDrawHand() feeds into
// mpLinkHandModel's joints 1/2. Confirmed via d_a_alink_wolf.inc's
// "revert from wolf to human" reset block, which sets ALL FOUR fields at
// once: mLeftHandJntNo=9, mRightHandJntNo=0xE, mLeftItemJntNo=10,
// mRightItemJntNo=0xF -- i.e. in human form the ITEM (sword/shield) joint
// is a DIFFERENT joint (10/0xF) from the HAND joint (9/0xE), presumably a
// child/sibling joint in the rig encoding the fixed grip offset between
// "where the wrist is" and "where a held object sits/is oriented in that
// grip." An earlier version of this fix wrongly assumed they were the
// same joint (they share a NUMBER-LOOKING resemblance -- 9/0xE for hands,
// 10/0xF for items, off by exactly one -- easy to misread quickly) and
// substituted the tracked HAND matrix directly for the item's position,
// which looked fine for the shield (a roughly flat/symmetric shape,
// forgiving of a moderate rotational offset) but visibly wrong for the
// sword (a long blade, where the same offset is obvious at the tip) --
// user-reported as "sheaths and unsheathes [correctly now] but is still
// facing the wrong way."
//
// Fix: don't substitute the tracked hand matrix directly. Instead,
// preserve whatever relative offset the body rig defines between the hand
// joint and the item joint, recomputed fresh every frame from mpLinkModel's
// own CURRENT animated matrices (works regardless of whether that offset
// is a rig constant or itself varies per-animation):
//   relativeOffset = inverse(handJointWorldMtx) * itemJointWorldMtx
//   trackedItemMtx = trackedHandMtx * relativeOffset
// i.e. "re-express the item's real current local relationship to the hand
// joint, but rooted at the TRACKED hand pose instead of the body's
// animated one." This is the same "insight" applyStaticCorrection's
// history (section 12) already contains in a different guise: composing a
// correction onto a LOCAL relationship (here, hand-to-item) rather than
// applying it after the fact to something already in world space is what
// makes it correct in general, not just at one reference pose.
//
// Unlike applyTrackedHandMtx() above, this can't just poke mMtxBuffer
// directly: setAnmMtx() there overwrites an already-resolved joint-world
// matrix inside mpLinkHandModel's OWN joint hierarchy (mMtxBuffer), read
// directly at draw time with no further recalculation needed. Sword/shield
// have no such per-joint override -- setBaseTRMtx() only assigns
// J3DModel::mBaseTransformMtx, a plain member that calcAnmMtx() (called
// from calc()) reads to resolve the model's OWN joint tree the NEXT time
// calc() runs (J3DModel.cpp: calcAnmMtx() -> getJointTree().calc(mMtxBuffer,
// mBaseScale, mBaseTransformMtx)). Since these models were already calc()'d
// once this frame (setItemMatrix(), with the stale flatscreen-joint base
// matrix), changing mBaseTransformMtx alone here would have zero visible
// effect until some later frame's calc() happened to pick it up -- calc()
// must be called again right here, per eye, for the new base matrix to
// actually reach the draw. Sword/shield are small, simple models, so a
// second (or third, across both eyes) calc() per frame is not a
// perf concern (same reasoning as section 7's HUD billboard capture cost).
//
// FIRST VERSION OF THIS FIX (unconditional override) WAS WRONG -- reverted
// same session after in-headset testing. setItemMatrix() does NOT always
// attach sword/shield to the hand joint: it switches per frame between the
// hand-joint matrix above (sword: only when `mEquipItem == 0x103`, i.e.
// sword is Link's currently-EQUIPPED weapon -- `param_0` is always 0 at
// every real call site, so that's the whole condition in practice; shield:
// a wider OR-chain covering actively guarding/attacking/etc.) and a
// completely different, computed BELT/BACK-relative offset matrix (the
// `else` branch in setItemMatrix() -- e.g. sword sheathed while a DIFFERENT
// item like the bow is equipped, or shield stowed on the back) for
// everything else. The unconditional version overwrote BOTH cases with the
// tracked hand position, so a sheathed sword (while some other item was
// equipped) or a stowed shield ended up floating at the player's tracked
// hand instead of properly out of the way at the hip/back -- reported
// in-headset as "I see the shield when it's not equipped" and "I see the
// sword hilt when it's not equipped."
//
// Fix: only substitute the tracked matrix when setItemMatrix() actually

//
// Added 2026-08-20 same-day follow-up: user confirmed axis=2 fixed the

// a SEPARATE remaining problem -- "the shield is blocking the inside of
// my forearm, rather than the outside" -- i.e. it wraps around the wrong
// side of the arm despite showing the right texture. This is exactly the
// class of residual error a single mirror can leave behind: getting the
// FACING (chirality) axis right doesn't automatically also get the
// in-plane spin right, since those are two independent degrees of
// freedom a lone reflection doesn't fully pin down (the same general
// shape of problem as section 12's hand-rotation saga needing an axis
// mapping fix AND a separate residual static-offset pass).
//
// Derivation: the rotation BLOCK transforms with the IDENTICAL
// sign(r)*sign(c) pattern as mirrorLocalMtxAxis()'s (a diagonal +-1
// matrix's off-diagonal product pattern only depends on WHICH entries
// differ from the others, not their absolute sign, so a 180-degree
// rotation about axis `a` -- diag with +1 at `a`, -1 elsewhere -- and a
// mirror through axis `a` -- diag with -1 at `a`, +1 elsewhere --
// negate the exact same set of rotation entries). They differ only in
// TRANSLATION: a mirror negates just the axis's OWN component (see
// mirrorLocalMtxAxis()); a 180-degree rotation negates the two
// components NOT equal to `axis`, leaving that axis's own translation
// alone -- the opposite rule.
// BUG FIX 2026-08-20: this used to be a conjugation (D*R*D-style: negate
// entries where exactly one of row/col == axis, and negate the translation
// component on the other two axes). That rotates the whole local frame
// around its own ORIGIN (the hand joint's origin) -- for an item like the
// shield whose grip is offset from that origin, conjugation moves the
// item's apparent position to a different nearby point (a reflection of
// its offset through the origin) instead of spinning it in place. Reported
// by the user as "rotated 180 degrees, not just translated" while tuning
// vrSwapShieldExtraFlipAxis: the fist visibly moved instead of just
// flipping palm/back-of-hand orientation.
//
// Fix: rotate the item IN PLACE by post-multiplying the rotation block by
// D = diag(+1 at axis, -1, -1) (R_new = R * D), which applies the 180
// rotation in the item's own local/child frame, and leave translation
// completely untouched. Post-multiplying by a diagonal D scales each
// COLUMN c of R by D[c][c]: negate every row of the two columns that are
// NOT axis, leave the axis column unchanged. Still a proper rotation

// OUT OF SCOPE, left completely untouched: the 0x106 branch (attaches to

// drives a real fire/retract state machine across both item joints), and

// ADDED 2026-08-09 (user request: anchor the VR camera to Link's ROOT/CORE
// position -- current.pos, the same physics-driven position setMatrix()
// uses to place mpLinkModel itself -- plus a fixed vertical offset, instead
// of his animated head-joint position (getSubjectEyePos()/field_0x3768)
// directly. Motivation is comfort, not the still-open hands/body-lag bug
// (section 20): current.pos doesn't bob, roll, or lurch with idle sway,
// footstep impact, or getting knocked around the way the head joint does,
// so a camera anchored to it should feel much calmer during exactly those
// moments, at the deliberate cost of no longer tilting/bobbing with Link's
// own head lean -- a tradeoff, not a bug.
//
// The vertical offset is CALIBRATED rather than hand-tuned: captured once
// per first-person activation from the real, current getSubjectEyePos()
// value (`realEye.y - current.pos.y`) so it automatically lands at
// roughly the right height for whatever stance is active (standing,
// crouched, swimming, etc.) without needing a whole family of
// hand-authored per-mode constants the way setBodyPartPos()'s own
// localEyeFromRoot/horseLocalEyeFromRoot/boardLocalEyeFromRoot/
// canoeLocalEyeFromRoot/wlLocalEyeFromRoot already does for a different
// purpose (see that function, d_a_alink.cpp) -- then held FIXED until the
// next activation. Deliberately NOT re-sampled every frame/tick: doing so
// would just reintroduce the exact bob/roll this exists to remove, since
// getSubjectEyePos() is the animated value. kCoreAnchorHeightOffsetDefault
// is only a placeholder used for the handful of frames before the first
// real calibration ever runs (isFirstPerson() true before setBodyPartPos()
// has executed even once), immediately overwritten by the real calibration
// on the very first activation.

// but that constant is a LOCAL offset run through
// `mDoMtx_stack_c::multVec()` against the model's own joint-matrix stack
// (rotation/scale included, and very possibly a different root reference
// than current.pos), not a plain world-space Y delta against current.pos.y
// the way this file's `realEye.y - current.pos.y` is. The two were never

// conversation the ORIGINAL head-joint anchor (section 11's
// getSubjectEyePos(), pre-section-23) is more useful: it's what actually
// follows the authored animation/eyeline (a nod, a look-down, a lean) that
// a cutscene or conversation is often built around, rather than a rigid
// comfort-anchored point that never moves with it.
//
// Dispatches on the exact same "is an event currently running" condition
// isFirstPerson()'s own first branch already uses to distinguish ordinary
// gameplay from everything else (dialogue, cutscenes, door/transition
// events) -- reusing that condition here rather than inventing a second
// one, same "one shared definition" reasoning as isFirstPerson() itself.
// Caller must already know isFirstPerson(link) is true (same precondition
// as computeRawCoreAnchoredEye() above).
// SWIMMING (user request 2026-08-09, "fix the camera when swimming"):
// computeRawCoreAnchoredEye()'s height offset is calibrated ONCE per
// first-person activation (see s_coreAnchorCalibrated) and held fixed
// until first-person is left entirely (cutscene/Wolf/etc.) -- entering or
// leaving the water does NOT reset that calibration, so a player who
// calibrated standing on land and then goes for a swim keeps a stale,
// standing-height offset added on top of current.pos, which does not mean
// the same thing while swimming. The base game's own setBodyPartPos()
// explicitly special-cases swimming for its OWN eye-position math (see its
// FLG0_SWIM_UP/MODE_SWIMMING-gated branch, d_a_alink.cpp) -- confirming
// this really is a case the plain root+fixed-offset model was never
// designed to cover, not just an untested gap. Rather than reverse-engineer
// and duplicate that swim-specific math here, fall back to the same
// original, animation-driven head-joint anchor (getSubjectEyePos()) already
// used for cutscenes/dialogue below -- the base game's OWN swim-aware eye
// position, correct by construction for every stance (surface, diving,
// etc.) with no separate calibration needed. Effectively "use the
// already-proven first-person head anchor instead of the newer, swim-
// unverified comfort anchor" -- the same tradeoff this was requested as an
// explicit either/or ("fix the camera when swimming, or set the camera to
// first person").
//
// CRAWLING (user request 2026-08-09, "do the same fix with crawling"):
// identical reasoning -- the core anchor's calibrated height offset is
// captured once while standing and doesn't get invalidated by dropping
// into a crawl, so it's just as stale here as it was for swimming. Same
// fix: fall back to the raw head-joint anchor instead. See isCrawling()'s
// own comment for why this is an mProcID check, not a MODE_FLG bit.
//
// VINE CLIMBING (user request 2026-08-10, "make climbing vines
// specifically first person"): scoped to MODE_VINE_CLIMB specifically
// (d_a_alink.h, "used for vine climbing") -- a real, dedicated mode bit
// distinct from general MODE_CLIMB (ladders, weak walls), so ladder/
// weak-wall climbing is deliberately NOT affected by this, only vines.
// Same fallback as swimming/crawling: the core anchor's standing-height
// calibration doesn't hold up in a stance this different, and vine
// climbing already has its own animated eye/body pose the base game
// drives directly, same as swimming/crawling do.
//
// HOOKSHOT/CLAWSHOT (user request 2026-08-13, "make the camera first
// person when you are in the air being pulled by the clawshot, and when
// you are hanging on to a clawshot target"): same reasoning again --
// isFirstPerson() already permits first-person here (hookshot flight/
// hanging isn't a dEvt_control_c event, so it falls straight through
// isFirstPerson()'s "no event -- ordinary gameplay" branch), so this was
// never actually a first/third-person GATING problem. It's the same
// comfort-anchor-calibration gap as swimming/crawling/vine-climbing:
// the core anchor's standing-height offset doesn't mean anything while
// Link is horizontal mid-air on the end of a chain, or hanging off a
// wall/ceiling at an odd angle. See isHookshotAirborneOrHanging()'s own
// comment for exactly which PROC states this covers.
//
// MOUNTED (horse/canoe/board) GAMEPLAY (fix 2026-08-13, user report:
// "the camera going above or below Link after certain loads or cutscenes
// ... get on epona and it will be too high"): same underlying gap as
// swimming/crawling/vine-climbing/hookshot above, just never previously
// added to this list -- section 11/23's own notes explicitly flagged
// mounted gameplay as "expected to work with zero additional code" but
// NEVER actually confirmed in-headset. It doesn't hold up: setBodyPartPos()
// (d_a_alink.cpp) computes the animated eye position for these three modes
// via dedicated horseLocalEyeFromRoot/canoeLocalEyeFromRoot/
// boardLocalEyeFromRoot offsets applied through a matrix stack rooted at
// field_0x3834 (getRootPosP(), the model's own joint-0 world position) --
// a structurally different derivation than plain standing, not just a
// different constant. The core anchor's calibrated s_coreAnchorHeightOffset
// is captured once (almost always while standing, since that's the far
// more common state to first enter first-person in) and held fixed
// forever, so applying it on top of current.pos.y while mounted produces a
// height that means something different than what it was calibrated
// for -- explaining "too high" while riding. Falling back to the same
// already-mount-aware getSubjectEyePos() used for cutscenes/dialogue above
// (which is what this whole codepath used before section 23 introduced the
// core anchor) fixes this by construction, the same way it already did for
// swim/crawl/vine/hookshot. This ALSO explains "get off epona and the
// camera will be on the ground" even without touching the core-anchor
// domain: since mounting/dismounting during ordinary gameplay never runs a
// dEvt_control_c event (checkEventRun() stays false the whole time, per
// isFirstPerson()'s own comment on this exact point), nothing was ever
// resetting/recalibrating s_coreAnchorHeightOffset around a mount/dismount
// either -- if a player's FIRST first-person activation in a session
// happened to land while already mounted (e.g. loading a save that starts
// on horseback, or a cutscene ending mid-ride), the one-shot calibration
// would capture the MOUNTED relationship between current.pos.y and eye
// height instead of the standing one, and that wrong-for-standing offset
// would then persist after dismounting too, until the next
// isFirstPerson() false->true transition (a later cutscene/dialogue).
// Excluding mounted gameplay from this domain entirely removes that whole
// failure mode, not just the in-the-moment "too high while riding" case.
//
// HORSE (Epona) BACKWARD/UP NUDGE (fix 2026-08-14, user report, after
// confirming the height fix above: "the camera phases through her head
// and it's way too far ahead of link's body"). getSubjectEyePos()'s
// horseLocalEyeFromRoot offset ({1.75, 55.0, 25.5}, setBodyPartPos(),
// d_a_alink.cpp) was authored for the flatscreen third-person camera's own
// needs -- a first-person VR headset sitting directly at that same point
// sits far enough forward (and, per a same-day follow-up report, too low)
// to clip through Epona's own head/neck geometry. Pulls the anchor BACK
// along Link's body-facing direction (current.angle.y, the same field/
// convention computeRawCoreAnchoredEye() uses for its own (vrStableCamera
// off) forward-offset nudge, just negated here) and UP, both by fixed
// real-world distances. Scoped to horse riding only (checkReinRide()) --

//
// dusk::game_clock's sim tick runs at a fixed sim_pace() = 1/30s (~33ms,
// game_clock.cpp), and advance_main_loop() deliberately targets
// `render_time = now - kSimPeriodDuration` -- i.e. this whole engine's
// interpolation scheme (both the shared dusk::frame_interp used by the
// flatscreen camera, and this VR-local copy of the same technique) is
// designed to always render exactly one full sim tick BEHIND real time,
// on purpose, so it only ever blends between two already-known past
// samples and never has to guess. That's a real, constant ~33ms of
// latency, not just jitter -- worked through with pen and paper: at
// step=0 (right after prev/curr were captured) render shows `prev`,
// which is exactly one tick older than `curr`; at step→1 (just before
// the next tick) render shows ≈`curr`, which is itself already ~33ms
// old by then. The delay is constant across the whole cycle, not
// "averages out" -- which is why it read as a flat, constant-feeling lag
// rather than jitter once jitter itself was already fixed.
//
// Fix: EXTRAPOLATE instead of interpolate, i.e. estimate today's
// position by continuing the (curr - prev) velocity forward from `curr`
// by `step` more, instead of only ever blending between two samples that
// are both already in the past. Implemented by reusing lerpXyz() itself
// with `t = step + kEyeAnchorExtrapolationGain` instead of plain `step`
// -- lerpXyz(a, b, t) for t>1 is already exactly
// `b + (b-a)*(t-1)`, i.e. "keep going past b at the same rate," so no
// separate function is needed. At gain=1.0 (full compensation), the
// render target becomes `curr + (curr-prev)*step`, which at step=0 shows
// `curr` itself (freshly computed THIS tick, zero added lag) and at
// step→1 shows the predicted position for the tick boundary that's
// about to happen -- i.e. close to true real-time throughout, not
// constantly ~33ms behind.
//
// Known, accepted tradeoff: unlike pure interpolation (which can never
// overshoot, since it only ever blends between two confirmed real
// samples), extrapolation predicts based on the ASSUMPTION that velocity
// stays roughly constant for one more tick -- if Link suddenly stops
// (hits a wall, releases the stick) mid-cycle, this can overshoot past
// the real position for up to one tick (~33ms) before the next real
// sample corrects it, producing a brief, smoothly-self-correcting
// (not a hard pop/teleport) settle rather than a hard stop. Judged
// preferable to a CONSTANT, ever-present lag during all normal fast
// movement, which is what was actually reported as bothersome. If
// overshoot on sudden stops/direction changes turns out to be its own
// problem once tested in-headset, dial `kEyeAnchorExtrapolationGain` down
// from 1.0 toward 0.0 (0.0 = back to the original pure-interpolation,
// always-~33ms-behind behavior) rather than reverting this wholesale --
// same "ship a named, empirically-tunable constant" pattern already used
// elsewhere in this file (e.g. the swing detector's thresholds,
// vr_stereo_render.hpp's kHudDampingAlpha).
//
// Deliberately scoped to ONLY this VR-local eye-anchor lerp, not the
// shared dusk::frame_interp module the flatscreen camera and other
// interpolated matrices use -- this needed to be provably isolated to
// the one thing the user actually reported (VR hands/view lag), not a
// blanket engine-wide behavior change with much wider (and untested)
// blast radius.
//
// CHANGED 2026-09-28: 1.0 -> 0.0 (back to pure interpolation) while
// game.vrStableCamera is on (the default); off keeps the original 1.0. The
// "known, accepted tradeoff" above is what was reported as uncomfortable:
// every start/stop/sharp turn overshot by up to one tick of Link's movement
// and then snapped back, and during steady movement the camera sat a full
// tick AHEAD of the world, which (per the header comment above) is itself
// rendered one tick behind real time via dusk::frame_interp. At 0.0 the

// FIXED 2026-08-08 (section 20 continuation -- user report, after
// late-latching turned out to be a red herring: "link's entire body lags
// behind, including the hands. If I move the headset [i.e. as Link moves]
// ... and thats for all direction[s]"). Root cause, found by reading code
// rather than guessing a fourth time: `daAlink_c::setMatrix()`
// (`d_a_alink.cpp`) builds `mpLinkModel`'s own base transform directly
// from raw `current.pos`/`shape_angle` with ZERO interpolation, and is
// only ever called from `execute()` -- i.e. once per 30Hz SIM TICK, same
// as the rest of this engine's fixed-timestep game logic. Meanwhile the
// CAMERA (and, sharing the same anchor, the tracked HANDS) read
// `getVrCameraEyeAnchor()` above, which smooths AND extrapolates every
// render frame (72-90Hz in VR). The result: whenever Link is actually
// moving, the camera/hands glide smoothly ahead each render frame (per
// `kEyeAnchorExtrapolationGain`, literally extrapolated PAST the latest
// confirmed sim-tick sample) while his own BODY MESH's world position
// stays frozen at whatever `execute()` last set it to, visibly stair-
// stepping 30 times a second behind them -- exactly "body lags behind...
// for all directions" (direction-independent because extrapolation
// applies the same way regardless of which way Link is moving) and
// exactly why standing still ("the intro") looked fine (zero velocity ==
// zero extrapolation == nothing to diverge). This was very likely the
// TRUE cause of the original "hands lag" report too, more so than the
// compositor-reprojection theory section 20 was chasing -- the previous
// late-latching fix (re-sampling controller pose closer to draw time)
// was solving a real but apparently much smaller problem than this one.
//
// Fix: rather than building a SECOND, independent prev/curr+extrapolation
// tracker for current.pos/shape_angle (real risk of the two drifting out
// of sync under future tuning -- this file's own standing lesson, see
// vr_smooth_turn.hpp's header comment), reuse the eye anchor's smoothing
// directly. `getVrCameraEyeAnchor()` already computes exactly how far
// this frame's smoothed/extrapolated eye position has been pushed away
// from the raw, this-sim-tick `getSubjectEyePos()` value -- that same
// world-space delta is what the whole body needs applied to it too, to
// stay visually rigid with the camera/hands. Returns zero whenever
// `isFirstPerson()` is false (cutscenes, Wolf form, mounted cutscenes --
// see that function's own comment): the camera doesn't get any smoothing

// Fix, mirroring applyVrBodyPositionOffset()'s own shape: rather than

// CORRECTED 2026-09-08: the first version of this fix (built, never
// confirmed conclusively fixed in-headset -- see the "PAUSED for the

// `result = base * yRot` (a RIGHT-multiply) on the theory that Y-axis
// rotations compose additively regardless of what's chained around them.
// That's true only when comparing two PURE Y rotations directly -- it does
// NOT mean right-multiplying the ALREADY-BUILT `base = T(pos) * Ry(y) *
// Rx(x) * Rz(z)` by Ry(delta) is equivalent to having used `y + delta`
// in setMatrix() in the first place. Re-derived algebraically: since
// Ry(a)*Ry(b) == Ry(a+b), `T(pos) * Ry(y+delta) * Rx(x) * Rz(z) ==
// T(pos) * Ry(delta) * Ry(y) * Rx(x) * Rz(z) == T(pos) * Ry(delta) *
// [Ry(y)*Rx(x)*Rz(z)]` -- i.e. Ry(delta) needs to be inserted as a
// LEFT-multiply of the ROTATION-ONLY block (Ry(y)*Rx(x)*Rz(z)), not a
// right-multiply of the whole already-built matrix. The old right-multiply
// applied Ry(delta) as the INNERMOST rotation (even before Rz(shape_angle.z)
// and Rx(shape_angle.x)), which only happens to equal the correct answer
// when pitch/roll (shape_angle.x/z) are exactly zero -- true standing on
// flat ground facing forward, false on any slope or during animations that
// set shape_angle.x/z, silently drifting wrong exactly when that's
// nonzero. Left-multiplying `yRot * base` gives the correct rotation
// submatrix, but ALSO rotates `base`'s translation column (`yRot * t`,
// since MTXConcat(a,b,c) computes c=a*b and a plain matrix product
// combines both parts) -- so this only touches the 3x3 rotation block and
// leaves the translation column (already correct, possibly pre-adjusted
// by applyVrBodyPositionOffset() above) completely untouched, rather than
// building a full new 4x4 and needing to restore translation afterward.
//
// `freshHeadYawS` is passed in by the caller (d_a_alink.cpp already calls
// dusk::vr::getHeadMoveAngleS() directly elsewhere; this header
// deliberately doesn't include vr_main.hpp, same "keep heavier VR-session
// headers out of this lower-level file" layering this file already
// follows). `delta` is computed fresh every call as (real head yaw right
// now) - (shape_angle.y as it currently stands, i.e. whatever the last
// setMatrix() call actually used) -- correct regardless of exactly when
// within a tick setMatrix() or execute()'s own override ran, since
// shape_angle.y doesn't change again until the next tick.
//
// Gated on isVrForcingBodyYawToHeadset(link) (NOT just isFirstPerson()) --
// during any of that shared gate's excluded states, shape_angle.y is NOT
// being driven toward the headset at all, so "real head yaw minus
// shape_angle.y" would be an arbitrary, meaningless delta there; applying
// it would visibly fight e.g. Iron Boots' wall-normal orientation. Called
// once per eye, right alongside applyVrBodyPositionOffset() above.
// TEMP DIAGNOSTIC 2026-09-09 -- added after the round-5 rotation-math fix
// (left-multiply instead of right-multiply, see the big comment above)
// was tested and reported STILL broken, with a much more specific
// symptom this time: "when standing still, the body is in the right
// place, but when I rotate it the body seems offset. By the time I
// rotate a full 180 degrees behind me the body is in front of me. It
// quickly snaps back... when I walk forward. When walking backward the
// body comes out in front of me." That's a POSITIONAL symptom tied to
// rotation angle, not a pure facing-direction bug -- doesn't match
// anything the round-5 fix (which only ever touches the 3x3 rotation
// block, explicitly leaving translation untouched) should be able to
// cause on its own. Leading candidate theories, neither confirmed:
// (a) computeRawCoreAnchoredEye()'s 6in forward-nudge uses
// current.angle.y (the MOVEMENT-facing angle), which per checkInputOnR()
// only updates while the stick is actively held -- if it's staying
// frozen while the player turns their head with the stick idle, this
// nudge shouldn't be able to sweep at all, but that assumption has never
// actually been checked with real data; (b) something else entirely
// (mBodyAngle, a torso-twist term, or an interaction with
// getVrBodyPositionOffset()'s own extrapolation) is the actual source.
// Logs everything needed to settle this in one capture: real head yaw,
// current shape_angle.y/current.angle.y, current.pos, whether the stick
// is held, and the body position-offset delta (should be exactly zero
// while genuinely standing still -- if it isn't, that's the smoking gun).
// Throttled to ~2/sec normally, plus an unconditional log on any frame
// where the position offset exceeds a "shouldn't happen while standing
// still" threshold, to catch the exact moment things go wrong without
// needing a huge paste. Remove once this is root-caused.

// applyVrBodyPositionOffset()/applyVrBodyYawOffset() were NEVER BEING

// capture, NEVER runs during a real VR eye pass (only via the legacy

// original finding. Nobody had migrated the body position/yaw offset
// fixes to the same "live" pattern already used for hands/sword/shield/
// held items when they were added -- this function does that now.
//
// With these two fixes confirmed dead code the whole time, the ONLY thing
// actually affecting the real per-eye render was the TICK-RATE
// `shape_angle.y = getHeadMoveAngleS()` override in `execute()`'s tail
// (d_a_alink.cpp) -- which snaps shape_angle.y directly to head yaw once
// per ~30Hz sim tick, with mpLinkModel's resulting per-JOINT draw matrices
// then subject to `dusk::frame_interp`'s own once-per-tick snapshot
// substitution (same mechanism section 20's whole saga root-caused for
// hands/sword/shield -- see that section's "ACTUALLY FINALLY RESOLVED"
// box) UNLESS marked live. mpLinkModel was never being marked live at
// all before this fix (no existing markModelJointsLive(bodyModel) call
// site anywhere) -- meaning every real frame's body draw was showing a
// frame_interp-substituted blend between the last TWO once-per-tick
// snapshots of shape_angle.y, not the current tick's real value. For
// ordinary tick-rate animation this kind of blend is normal/desirable
// (matches how the rest of this engine's animation smoothing works) --
// but for a value that can, in principle, change by a large amount in a
// single tick (a fast real head turn), naively interpolating between two
// ROTATION MATRICES that are far apart (worst case: nearly antipodal,
// i.e. ~180° apart) is a well-known degenerate case for plain per-element
// matrix lerp (as opposed to quaternion slerp) -- it does not simply
// "undershoot," it can produce a matrix with badly wrong translation/scale
// behavior partway through the blend, growing worse the further apart the
// two ends are. This matches the reported symptom shape exactly: fine
// standing still (zero delta -- nothing to interpolate away from),
// increasingly wrong approaching a 180° turn (worst-case interpolation
// distance), corrects itself once real per-tick deltas shrink again
// (walking forward apparently makes current.angle.y/mMoveAngle catch up
// to shape_angle.y fast enough that large single-tick jumps stop
// happening). NOT yet independently confirmed via a targeted capture that
// this specific mechanism (rather than merely "the offset fixes were
// dead") is the exact source of the positional symptom -- but marking
// mpLinkModel's joints live, the same fix already proven for every other
// tracked-pose model in this file, removes frame_interp's substitution
// from the picture entirely regardless of exactly how it was going wrong,
// so it should resolve this class of bug the same way it did for hands/
// sword/shield even without pinning down the precise matrix-lerp failure
// mode.
//
// ROUND 8 UPDATE (2026-09-10) -- this WAS wired live (called from
// vr_main.cpp's tick(), as this comment used to describe), and the
// result disproved the theory above rather than confirming it. Real
// in-headset report once genuinely live: "The rotation problem isn't
// fixed, turning 180 still puts the body in front of me. The body also
// now moves in a very stuttery way, looks like it updates at 30hz...
// When running forward it goes ahead of me now instead of being in the
// right place... instead of previously where moving forwards looked good
// but backwards it lagged, the body goes in front of me with any
// movement." Two real, confirmed regressions, and the ORIGINAL target
// symptom (180° facing offset) was UNCHANGED:
// 1. **Stutter regression**: `markModelJointsLive(bodyModel)` marks
//    EVERY joint of the FULL BODY skeleton live, not just the root/base
//    placement -- unlike sword/shield/hands/held items (small, ~rigid
//    models with no meaningful skeletal ANIMATION of their own to lose),
//    mpLinkModel has real walk-cycle/idle/breathing animation that
//    frame_interp's normal tick-to-tick blending smooths continuously.
//    Marking every joint live disables that blending entirely, so the
//    body's own ANIMATION (not just the position/yaw correction) now only
//    updates once per ~30Hz tick with zero cross-tick smoothing -- the
//    reported stutter. There is no cheap way to mark "just the root" live
//    while leaving the rest smoothed: frame_interp substitutes each
//    joint's already-composed WORLD matrix independently, so a corrected
//    root can only reach a child joint's rendered matrix if that child is
//    ALSO marked live (and thus also loses its own tick-to-tick animation
//    blending). This technique, proven correct for small non-animated
//    items, does not transfer to the full animated body.
// 2. **Position overshoot regression**: `getVrBodyPositionOffset()`'s
//    formula (full one-tick-ahead EXTRAPOLATION, `kEyeAnchorExtrapolationGain
//    = 1.0`) is valid for the camera/hands because those track a REAL,
//    physically-continuous external quantity (the HMD/controllers) where
//    "keep going at the same velocity for one more tick" is a reasonable
//    prediction. Link's own `current.pos` is SIMULATED, discrete,
//    tick-rate game logic with no such continuity guarantee -- velocity
//    can change abruptly between ticks (starting/stopping/turning) in a
//    way a real physical body's momentum can't, so extrapolating it ahead
//    overshoots, and does so for ANY movement once actually live (not
//    just backward, as the pre-existing dead-code state's OWN residual,
//    lesser bug happened to look like).
// 3. **Rotation NOT fixed even though genuinely live**: this is the most
//    important negative result -- it means the "frame_interp naively
//    lerping two far-apart rotation matrices" theory this function's own
//    header comment proposed is likely WRONG, not just unconfirmed. With
//    markModelJointsLive() bypassing frame_interp's substitution entirely,
//    the rendered body should have been using OUR fresh, real-frame-rate,
//    already-verified-correct (round 5) rotation correction directly --
//    and 180° still looked exactly as wrong as before. The real cause of
//    the reported "body ends up in front of me at 180°" symptom is still
//    NOT root-caused. Do not re-attempt "make this live again" as the

// smarter version of this same idea (e.g. correcting position WITHOUT
// extrapolation, or finding a way to propagate a root correction without
// disabling animation blending) is worth revisiting. The old
// d_a_alink.cpp dead-call-site (isEyePassOpen()-gated, inside
// daAlink_c::draw()) is what's actually "live" right now in the sense
// that it's the only place these two functions are still referenced from
// outside this file -- and it's still just as dead as section 20 already
// proved, so calling THIS function from THERE would change nothing.
