// vr_smooth_turn.hpp
//
// VR "smooth turn" comfort locomotion: the right thumbstick's horizontal
// axis smoothly rotates a persistent yaw offset, and every VR-tracked pose
// (camera eyes, tracked hands, the HUD billboard's world-forward reference)
// gets rotated by that same offset before use -- equivalent to rotating the
// whole physical play space under the player, since the HMD's own tracked
// orientation can't be faked directly. Added 2026-08-05 per explicit user
// request ("add smooth camera rotation to the right stick, unbind the
// C-stick"), replacing the right stick's previous raw C-stick/substick PAD
// binding (see CLAUDE.md section 13's mapping table and section 15).
//
// Deliberately a single shared header, not duplicated per call site: see
// CLAUDE.md section 14's lesson -- eyePoseToViewMtx and buildHandMtx used to
// each carry their OWN copy of a "matches the other one's convention"
// position formula, which silently drifted out of sync (one got fixed,
// the other didn't) and caused a real bug the same day this file was
// written. All three call sites that need yaw rotation (eyePoseToViewMtx/
// updateHudSmoothing in vr_stereo_render.hpp, buildHandMtx in
// vr_link_visibility.hpp) include this header and call the same two
// functions below, so there is exactly one implementation to keep correct.
//
// Math verified in a standalone script before use (not just derived on
// paper -- see CLAUDE.md section 15): rotating a local vector by
// rotateYawQuat(q, yaw) and then by R(q) gives the identical result (to
// float precision) as rotating R(q)*v directly by rotateYawXr(_, yaw), for
// 2000 random (q, yaw, v) trials -- confirms position and orientation
// rotate together consistently, the same property that mattered for the
// stereo-eyes-swap bug this same session fixed elsewhere. Also confirmed:
// rotateYawQuat always returns a unit quaternion, and yaw=0 is an exact
// no-op for both functions (safe default for any call site that isn't
// using smooth-turn).

// Scripted-camera facing assist (Third Person VR setting only, 2026-08-19
// request: "make the camera face the right way for scripted camera events
// that move it" -- Z-targeting orbiting behind Link, or a cutscene camera
// cut). Third Person mode's VR view orientation is otherwise driven purely
// by the real HMD pose (+ this same g_smoothTurnYawRad offset) -- it never
// reads the flatscreen game camera's own rotation at all, so when THAT
// camera reorients (Z-target, cutscene), only the VR camera's POSITION
// anchor follows (see isFirstPerson()'s Third Person fallback,
// vr_link_visibility.hpp); the rendered facing stays wherever the player's
// head/smooth-turn last left it. This nudges g_smoothTurnYawRad -- the
// SAME accumulator the right stick/real C-stick already drive -- to close
// that gap.
//
// Deliberately does NOT touch eyePoseToViewMtx's raw-quaternion orientation
// path directly -- that function's own comment (vr_stereo_render.hpp)
// explicitly warns against a 2026-08-05 attempt at exactly that, which
// reversed pitch/yaw entirely and had to be reverted. Routing through this
// same proven yaw-offset mechanism instead avoids that whole bug class.
//
// TWO EARLIER DESIGNS TRIED AND REJECTED, both same day, kept here so a
// future session doesn't re-attempt either blind:
// 1. Continuous full convergence (max 180 deg/s, always closing the gap to
//    exactly zero every frame). This is called EVERY FRAME the scripted
//    event is active, and the gap is recomputed each time against the
//    CURRENT combined yaw (real HMD rotation + this offset), not a fixed
//    target captured once -- so any voluntary head turn immediately became
//    new "gap" that this function then worked to erase, at up to 180 deg/s
//    -- comfortably outpacing a normal deliberate head turn (order
//    60-150 deg/s sustained), so it fought and won against essentially all
//    yaw input. User report: "I can look up and down mid cutscene, but not
//    left and right" (pitch is untouched by any of this, only yaw routes
//    through here).
// 2. Same mechanism, rate lowered to 20 deg/s (weak enough for voluntary
//    turning to outpace it) per an explicit follow-up request to make the
//    HMD direction "INFLUENCED... but not completely controlled." User
//    report: "it doesn't feel very good" -- a persistent, if weak,
//    background tug for the entire duration of every cutscene/Z-target
//    hold is still an unwanted constant force, not what "influenced" was
//    asking for; weakening the SAME continuous mechanism doesn't fix the
//    underlying wrong shape.
//
// CURRENT DESIGN (jump-cut detection, per explicit follow-up request:
// "just move the camera whenever a sudden change in direction from the
// original happens? Like in a jump cut"): stop trying to continuously
// track the target camera's direction at all. Instead, the caller
// (vr_main.cpp's tick()) compares this frame's target yaw against LAST
// frame's target yaw (not the player's own current view) -- a real
// flatscreen jump cut (a cutscene shot change, or Z-target's camera
// snapping in behind Link the instant lock-on engages) changes that target
// by a large amount within a single frame; smooth camera movement (e.g.
// Z-target's continuous orbit as Link/the target move) only changes it by
// a few degrees per frame at VR framerates. Only when that single-frame
// delta exceeds kScriptedCameraJumpCutThresholdDeg does the caller call
// snapScriptedCameraYaw() below -- an instant, unbounded reorientation,
// matching how a real jump cut is itself an instantaneous discontinuity on
// the flatscreen (this is also the same principle behind snap-turning as a
// VR comfort technique elsewhere: a sudden discrete jump is tolerated far
// better than a continuous forced rotation, because the brain already
// expects a full scene discontinuity at a cut). Smooth camera movement is
// left completely alone -- no pull, no drift, full free-look, all the
// time, except at the instant of an actual cut.
//
// gapRad is the signed angular gap (radians) to close, computed by the
// caller from two s16 BAMS angles run through the identical
// cM_atan2s(x, z) convention g_headMoveAngleS already uses for the HMD's
// own forward direction -- self-consistent by construction regardless of
// cM_atan2s's own internal sign convention, since both sides of the
// subtraction go through the same function. Verified numerically (not just
// derived) that increasing g_smoothTurnYawRad by a given radian amount
// increases that same cM_atan2s(x, z)-style angle by the same amount (1:1,
// same sign) -- so simply adding gapRad here converges the gap to exactly
// zero in one step.

// frames in a row are needed before actually calling it settled (avoids a
// single noisy near-zero frame ending tracking early, mid-swing); and
// kZTargetCameraTrackMaxDurationSec is a bounded fallback so an ongoing
// small camera adjustment (e.g. the player continuing to move while locked
// on -- normal, not part of the initial swing) can't withhold free-look
// indefinitely if it happens to never dip below the settle threshold.
